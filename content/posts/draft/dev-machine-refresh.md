## Setting the Stage

In a week of the news around xz utils backdoor vulnerabilitity, it provides a reminder that there are systems that we need to remain vigilant in monitoring. 

I'm a believer that one of our most vulnerable assets is our developer environments. We conduct tons of experimentation and use them to drive upgrades to downstream systems.

How are we keeping track of what is installed and the versions etc? seems like a solved problem - but I can guarantee that even big enterprise still remains vulnerable - more so in the age of containers.

Now take startup culture where the full spectrum of secure to wild west is a real possibility (I can sleep soundly knowing my organization is likely forward leaning in security here, although that may not have always been the case).

## Target Acquired

I have a development system that's been in continual daily-use for multiple years now. Experimentation across many open-source projects and ideas that have sprung into something executable. Many languages - many package managers - etc etc.



## Step 1 - Plan

## Step 2 - "rm -rf /*"

## Step 3 - Use Ephermeral as a feature
