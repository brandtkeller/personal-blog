## BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front)
The KCSA certification addresses a gap in cloud/container security fundamentals whereas the KCNA is focused on cloud/container foundations. This exam (KCSA) will require understanding some of the security pillars that exist and how to orchestrate them - as well as activities present in the threat-modeling of existing environments. 

If you are looking to bolster your security skills (or build them) in order to address this critical gap in cloud native environments - this could very well be a way to gain the skills you need to land a role in tech.

## Why this certification?

I made a post a few weeks back about adding the Kubernetes and Cloud Native Security Associate (KCSA) [certification](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/kubernetes-and-cloud-native-security-associate-kcsa/) to my LinkedIn profile. It was an opportunity the presented itself and I was naturally curious as to what it was about.

For transparency - I am middle of the road when it comes to certificates. There are certificates that I believe were a giant waste of time and really do not signify much (but are required for certain jobs) and there are others that I believe actually show some significance.

I won't be going into the certifications I don't believe are valuable - negativity is warranted in my blog and it largely doesn't accomplish much. But I will always talk about my perception of certifications for which I have first-hand experience. 

## Experience

I am certified for both the Certificated Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) and Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD). I am a firm believer that the way these certifications are executed combines the proper amount of knowledge about how to execute some task with the required ability to perform the task in an alloted time. 

There is a reasonable yet present threshold for these certifications required in order to perform the entirety of the content in the alloted time to receive the required score to pass.

Now I understand that this varies greatly across the intent of the certifications out today. These were very hands on and as such warranted the skills to operate within the linux environments. That doesn't mean standard exams against knowledge are not valuable - but that they represent a different given set of knowledge application.

## Why Certifications?

I believe that certifications represent an opportunity show that one is capable of performing some given threshold of tasks. Something like CKA/CKAD takes a beginner/intermediate level of knoweldge about Kubernetes and represents your ability to conduct most of the essential tasks against a live-cluster. 

If someone is looking to make a move into the Kubernetes space and wants to find tangible proof of their ability to perform the tasks, then this is a great opportunity to have the data for potential employment at an entry/junior level. This is of course in the absence of other experience and isn't a guarantee of success.

The part that I find most applicable about certifications is that they really can be an enabler for opening a conversation or potentially landing an entry level position. When I got out of the military and started attending college - I tried and tried to find any and all internship opportunities and came up dry for a while - Seattle area certainly had some competition. It took finding the right company and a looming bachelors degree to get me in the door to an entry level position. 

Should that always be the case? I don't think so - there are a lot of people passionate about making change that may not have the same opportunity I had (even if that opportunity was because of my military service).

There have to be other ways to get people into the doors of tech such that they can find their path. Tech has many paths and sometimes the novelty of "coding" tends to overshadow the realities. 

## Opportunity

All of that said, if someone were to come to me and ask for my advice for where to begin, I would have a variety of questions to help refine where they might begin targeting. One of those is opportunity, can you afford the time and/or money to pursue one activity or another?

Open Source has a lot of room for opportunity - albeit maybe not paid. But it can help build a portfolio too (a topic for another day).

Ultimately I want to be able to offer advice that I can speak to and that I can recommend. Certifications are not cheap.

## KCSA

Browsing the Kubernetes slack one day and I found a post discussing the open beta for the KCSA certification. I was curious and decided to give it a shot.

- 60-90 minutes
- Multiple Choice exam
- Beginner level
- Cloud and Container security skills 

Sounds like a good pre-cursor to something like the CKA/CKAD certs. The bonus was participating in the beta meant that the exam was free. Results wouldn't be provided for months until the Exam was out of beta.

## Exam Time

I set aside an hour of my day after work and performed the standard online proctored exam process. Moved my laptop to another surface and cleared the walls of any writing/moved screens away from my view.

Went through the exam without an preparation just to see what it would be like and was fine if I failed due to the specifics of the questions. 

The questions themselves were interesting - you can't get away with taking this exam blind without any kubernetes experience - that's for sure. Good security fundamentals are a must for this exam - which impressed me given that CKA/CKAD are less security focused (Hence why there is the CKS).

## Summary

As noted in the BLUF -
