KubeCon has wrapped up and with it I can definitively say that it was the most productive and impactful event in all of my previous KubeCon attendances. I went into this event with a strategy - which included observations and exploration as well as targeted tasks.

First and foremost - I ensured that I more than fulfilled my role in the CNCF as both an Ambassador as well as Technical Lead for the Security Technical Advisory Group (with a change of jackets to-boot). Engaging with other ambassadors (welcoming the new wave) and educating others about how to both apply and think tactically about the application process (willing to explain if interested). As an STAG representative - I had the pleasure of hosting the STAG Kiosk in the project pavilion and answering everyone's questions while encouraging involvement. 

Otherwise my primary strategy went into effect - meeting with all the people I wanted to connect with in-person as well as networking with new people and vendors to "be curious" and understand where and how to apply a new wave of technologies present. 

## Day 0

Prior to the official kickoff of KubeCon - Co-located events are in full swing with a focus on specific areas of focus. While there were events I was interested in attending - more so was an invitation from TestifySec to join a Public Sector Event. As public sector is something that I thoroughly believe is one of my fundamental missions, I was ready to participate and engage. Turns out I had more than a few friends present and learned much from others who focus on the public sector missions and problems that we need to collectively solve. 

This was followed with catching a few lightening talks before some of my pre-planning went into effect - having the ability to deliver a few Lula demos to those thinking about the automated governance problem space. Real-time feedback and iteration on what works well and what still needs refinement was and is an invaluable process. 

Finally closed out the evening by getting some dedicated time to review potential opportunities to collaborate in the OSCAL ecosystem. Brainstorming new ideas that can take recommendations and standards to new heights in a machine-readable execution. (more to follow here)

## Day 1

With the official first day of KubeCon kicking-off - we embrace the chaos of a _long_ day. Getting the day started with some cardio and weights before hitting the Ambassador breakfast and photo. Seeing the amount of ambassadors present was amazing. A group of people dedicated to being involved with the cloud native community in some way. I was privileged to walk away from breakfast having met some new friends. 

Keynotes kicked off with Patent Trolls being a topic first and foremost - an area of discussion that needs to be highlighted so that those impacted know there are entities present to help defend you and your organizations from these attacks.
