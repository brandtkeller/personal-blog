If there is one value that I believe has contributed to the most meaningful time spent - in work and out - it's the guiding principle that _How you do anything is how you do everything_. I don't know where I originally heard it - but it immediately resonated as a truth with me.

## Break it down

Hear me out - from the task that are very important and require intense focus - to the menial, routine tasks that require your attention in order to get them done - how you approach doing them is often consistent over time. Meaning that your system for approaching and solving any problem at hand is a byproduct of your systems. As James Clear puts it, "You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems". 

That applies here as well - maybe there is a clear overlap with habits and systems of applying yourself to the task at hand. Nonetheless I've come to believe that an underlying indicator of success is how you approach problems when it's not the most exciting task that still needs to be done. 

## Take us back

Some old wisdom imparted on me in my early days in the Marine Corps was to volunteer for everything and have the fortitude to do it with dignity. No matter how trivial the task - you can either volunteer or be voluntold in the military - so might as well take the "W" and sign yourself up and then produce the best result you can. 

That has stuck with me in a variety of productive ways. A given task often needs to be done - so let's approach it with the best intentions and the best effort we can muster.

## Other side of the coin

You know you give eah and every task your all - yet you still find your standard slipping for some reason or another - is this a red flag? 

Maybe, depending on how you look at it. I like to look at these instances as potential data points to learn from. Why is this occurring? Are you working on solving the symptom instead of the actual problem itself? 

Or maybe it is an indicator that you know where your current time and effort needs to be directed and there is a possibility this is a task for someone else to own. 

This can be a great exercise for guarding your time - something that I believe we all need to be more cognizant and aware of - in order to ensure you are focusing on efforts that require your full attention and effort.

## From here on out

The real message here is a belief that applying yourself and owning the task at hand requires a certain level of commitment and dedication and more often will result in the task output being a reflection of your dedication to the input.
