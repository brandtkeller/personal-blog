What do we love? Data!

Especially when the data is fun to aggregate and process. 

I've been using a free Strava account for years now. It tracks my workouts and gives me some high-level information to share with friends and followers. 

## Desk Treadmill data

For each workout that I have been recording with the hardware from the previous post, I've specifically been naming them "Desk Treadmill" such that I could easily aggregate them in the future.

## The future is now.
With some setup that I call out in my [strava-api]() repository, I was able to start hitting the Strava API and collecting data. The fun? you can too! 

It's pretty easy and straightforward to get the tokens you need to repeatably collect activities from the API and process them how you see fit.
