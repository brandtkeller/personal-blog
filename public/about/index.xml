      <description>Father, Husband, and general DIY busy body. Software by trade and Mission by heart.
Who am I? I consider myself a great many things. The most important to me are listed above (Father and Husband). Outside of those, I&amp;rsquo;m just a guy who loves to learn and apply what I know to accomplish whatever the current mission dictates.
My Experience My focus has been driven through my experiences. From getting to experience different parts of the world in the USMC, to college and my foray into the world of software - executing on what was priority at the time and always getting things started/moving early has paid dividends in each position I have been placed.</description>
